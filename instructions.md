# AI Mental Health Coach - Development Plan

## Project Overview
Building an AI-powered mental health coach that provides anxiety and depression support through voice interactions, maintains memory across sessions, assigns therapeutic homework, and distinguishes between formal sessions and casual chats.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Voice Processing Layer**
   - Speech-to-text conversion
   - Text-to-speech output
   - Real-time audio streaming
   - Conversation transcription storage

2. **Memory Management System**
   - **Important Memories Storage**: AI-curated key insights, breakthroughs, triggers, coping strategies
   - **RAG System**: Full conversation history for contextual retrieval
   - **Session Metadata**: Track formal vs casual interactions, homework assignments, progress notes

3. **AI Processing Engine**
   - LLM with CBT and behavioral activation frameworks
   - Crisis detection algorithms
   - Memory consolidation tools
   - Homework assignment generation

4. **User Interface**
   - Web application (v0)
   - Session scheduling interface
   - Transcript viewing
   - Progress tracking dashboard

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: MVP Text-Based Coach (Weeks 1-6)
**Goal**: Prove core concept with minimal viable product

**Tasks**:
- Set up basic web app with text chat
- Implement user authentication and profiles
- Create simple conversation storage
- Build basic memory tool (store 3-5 key insights per conversation)
- Integrate LLM with simple CBT prompting
- Add basic homework assignment feature

**Deliverable**: Working text-based mental health coach that remembers key details

**Success Criteria**: 10 test users can have meaningful conversations over multiple sessions

### Phase 2: Voice Integration (Weeks 7-10)
**Goal**: Add voice capabilities (start with Web Speech API to control costs)

**Tasks**:
- Integrate browser-based speech-to-text
- Add text-to-speech output
- Build simple audio controls
- Test voice latency and quality
- Add conversation transcription
- Implement voice/text toggle

**Deliverable**: Voice-enabled coach with cost-controlled approach

**Success Criteria**: Voice conversations feel natural with <3 second response time

### Phase 3: Session Structure & Safety (Weeks 11-14)
**Goal**: Add professional structure and basic safety features

**Tasks**:
- Build session scheduling system
- Create session vs chat logic
- Implement basic crisis keyword detection
- Add emergency resource information
- Build homework tracking system
- Create user progress dashboard

**Deliverable**: Structured therapy-like experience with safety guardrails

**Success Criteria**: Users can schedule sessions, complete homework, and system detects obvious crisis language

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Weeks 15-18)
**Goal**: Enhance memory and add sophisticated features

**Tasks**:
- Implement RAG for conversation history (if needed based on Phase 1-3 feedback)
- Enhance crisis detection with multiple indicators
- Add emergency contact system
- Build user analytics and progress tracking
- Implement advanced therapeutic techniques

**Deliverable**: Feature-complete mental health coach

**Success Criteria**: System handles complex scenarios and provides measurable user value

## Technical Implementation Details

### Memory System Architecture
```
User Conversation → AI Analysis → Categorization:
├── Important Memory (stored separately)
├── RAG Chunks (conversation segments)
└── Session Metadata (homework, progress)
```

### Session vs Chat Logic
- **Formal Session**: Scheduled time slots, structured framework, time-limited
- **Casual Chat**: Anytime access, supportive but less structured, unlimited

### Crisis Detection Framework
**Trigger Indicators**:
- Direct statements of self-harm intent
- Hopelessness combined with specific plans
- Substance abuse mentions with safety concerns
- Repeated crisis-level language patterns

**Response Protocol**:
1. Immediate calming techniques
2. Safety assessment questions
3. Emergency contact activation (if severe)
4. Follow-up session scheduling

### Cost-Effective Voice Processing Strategy
**Phase 1**: Web Speech API (browser-based, completely free)
**Phase 2**: OpenAI Whisper (self-hosted, one-time setup cost)
**Phase 3**: Cloud services only if user base justifies cost

**Cost Management**:
- Start with 5-minute session limits
- Use text as fallback when voice fails
- Implement conversation summarization to reduce processing
- Consider hybrid voice/text for longer conversations

## Data Architecture

### User Profile Schema
```json
{
  "user_id": "unique_id",
  "session_schedule": ["monday_10am", "thursday_3pm"],
  "important_memories": [
    {
      "memory_id": "uuid",
      "content": "User's anxiety triggers include...",
      "category": "triggers",
      "date_created": "timestamp",
      "importance_score": 0.9
    }
  ],
  "homework_assignments": [
    {
      "assignment": "Practice breathing exercises daily",
      "assigned_date": "timestamp",
      "due_date": "timestamp",
      "completed": false,
      "progress_notes": []
    }
  ],
  "conversation_history": "stored_separately_for_rag"
}
```

### Memory Tool Functions
- `store_important_memory(content, category, importance_score)`
- `retrieve_relevant_memories(current_context)`
- `assign_homework(task, timeline, follow_up_date)`
- `check_crisis_indicators(conversation_segment)`

## Therapeutic Framework Integration

### CBT Components
- Thought record techniques
- Behavioral activation scheduling
- Cognitive restructuring exercises
- Homework assignments for practice

### Session Structure Template
1. **Check-in** (5 mins): How are you feeling? Homework review
2. **Main Topic** (20-25 mins): Structured therapeutic work
3. **Skill Practice** (5-10 mins): Techniques application
4. **Wrap-up** (5 mins): Summary, homework assignment

## Regulatory & Safety Considerations

### Legal Positioning
- Clear "mental health coach" vs "therapist" distinction
- Terms of service emphasizing complementary support
- Crisis intervention as emergency bridge, not replacement for professional help

### User Safety Features
- Regular check-ins for suicidal ideation
- Resource lists for professional help
- Clear escalation procedures
- Data privacy and encryption

## Testing Strategy

### User Testing Phases
1. **Alpha**: Internal testing with simulated conversations
2. **Beta**: Limited user testing with volunteers
3. **Pilot**: Small group of actual users with feedback collection

### Key Metrics
- User engagement rates
- Crisis detection accuracy
- Memory relevance scoring
- Homework completion rates
- User satisfaction surveys

## Deployment Strategy

### Infrastructure
- Cloud hosting (Firebase/Vercel for web app)
- Database (PostgreSQL for structured data)
- Vector database (Pinecone/Chroma for RAG)
- Voice processing APIs

### Scaling Considerations
- Conversation storage optimization
- Memory pruning strategies
- Cost monitoring for voice processing
- User load balancing

## Risk Mitigation & Realistic Concerns

### Technical Risks
- **Voice processing limitations**: Web Speech API works only in supported browsers
- **Memory system performance**: Simple approach first, scale complexity based on actual need
- **Crisis detection accuracy**: Start with obvious keywords, improve iteratively with real data

### Product Risks
- **User retention**: Build habit-forming features (streaks, progress visualization)
- **Regulatory issues**: Consult legal expert before public launch
- **Crisis liability**: Clear disclaimers, immediate professional resource redirection

### Student Project Constraints
- **Time management**: 18-week timeline assumes 10-15 hours/week commitment
- **Cost control**: Start free-tier only, upgrade based on user adoption
- **Technical support**: Plan for simpler features if complex ones prove difficult

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Weekly milestone reviews** to catch issues early
- **User feedback loops** from week 6 onwards
- **Fallback plans** for each major feature
- **Professional consultation** for legal and safety aspects

## Success Metrics

### Short-term (3 months)
- 50+ active users
- 80%+ session completion rate
- Sub-2 second voice response time
- Zero crisis intervention failures

### Long-term (1 year)
- 1000+ active users
- Measurable anxiety/depression improvement scores
- Partnership with mental health professionals
- Sustainable cost structure

## Next Steps
1. Validate technical feasibility with voice processing demos
2. Create detailed wireframes for web interface
3. Set up development environment and basic chat functionality
4. Begin user research and feedback collection framework
